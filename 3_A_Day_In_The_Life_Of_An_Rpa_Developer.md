***What makes a process a good candidate for automation?***

There are two sets of criteria you can use to determine automation potential: 

***Process Fitness***
- Rule-Based (Process needs to have pre-defined logic + The exception rate is either low or can be included as well in the business logic)
- Automatable and/or reptitive
- Standart Input (The input in the process should either be electronic or easily readable or readable technology can be associated with Rpa (Such as OCR))
- Stable (Process that have been same for a certain period. No changes are expected)
	
	 
***Automation complexity***
- Number of screens (The higher the number of screens, the more elements have to be captured and configured before process automation.)
- Types of applications (Some applications are more easily automated (such as the Office suite or browsers), others heavily increase the automation effort (Mainframe, for example).)
- Business logic scenarios (An automation's complexity increases with the number of decision points in the business logic. 	
- Types and number of inputs 

***How do RPA project implementations work?***
- Discovery and Kick Off (assess the potential automations)
- Process Analysis (identifies the requirements of the customerâ€™s processes.)
- Solution Design (the technical team designs a future state flow and maps out the various modules that'll have to be developed to complete the automation.)
- Development Unit Testing
- Integration and User Acceptance Testing (Uat)
- Deployment and Hypercare
