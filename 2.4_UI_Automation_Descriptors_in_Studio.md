***Key targeting methods used in UI automation***

- Strict Selectors

- Fuzzy Selectors

- Image

---


***Target*** 


- Refers to a specific UI element that we want to interact with. It could be any component on the user interface, like a button, textbox, or dropdown list. 
To ensure accurate identification of targets, we can use an anchor. 


***Anchor***

- An anchor is an additional UI element that helps in identifying the target. Anchors are particularly useful when potential conflicts are detected in the selection window. By incorporating multiple anchors, we enhance the reliability and accuracy of our automation.



***Strict Selectors***


- Strict Selectors use XML fragments to identify user interface elements based on their attributes. 
They require an exact match to the address and attributes of the element, providing precise targeting. 


***Fuzzy Selectors***


- Fuzzy Selectors enable the identification of elements based on patterns or partial matches, allowing for more flexibility. 
They validate selectors using multiple attributes, accommodating changes during the automation process. 

    
***Image***


- Image Selection method reads the array of pixels in a visible region of the application window to identify if it matches the target array. 
It's useful when other targeting methods can't be applied or in virtual machine environments. 

    
***Window selector***

 
- The Window Selector targets the entire window or application rather than specific windows within it. 
It's used when automating UI interactions at the application level. 
The Window Selector option is available in the "Use Application or Browser" activity when the "Window Attach Mode" property isn't set to "Single window."

***Unified Targeting Method***


- The Unified Target method, a modern solution for UI automation, simplifies the interaction with user interfaces by incorporating various technologies and methods like Selectors, 
Fuzzy Selectors, and Images to identify UI elements. 



- A Unified Target consists of at least one target, along with optional anchors. 


-  Each UI element is located using a stack of targeting methods, including Strict Selectors, Fuzzy Selectors, and Images. 


- These targeting methods work redundantly, simultaneously attempting to identify the target element. The first method that successfully finds the target is considered.

- The Unified Targeting method employs multiple targeting methods, including Selector, Fuzzy Selector, and Image, to identify and locate UI elements. These methods work in parallel to search for target and anchor elements. The method that successfully identifies the element first is used to create the Descriptor used to identify the UI element. 


- A descriptor is a unique pair consisting of an anchor element and a target element. It's generated when both the anchor and target are successfully identified using their respective targeting methods.

***There are two options available to assess the reliability of your UI automation configuration.*** 

- ***Show All Matches*** : The "Show all matches" feature helps to identify all the possible matches for the selected element within the automated application. This option is useful for debugging UI descriptors or selections, allowing you to ensure the accuracy of your automation setup.


- ***Target element validation*** : Target element validation allows you to assess the effectiveness of the current selection in accurately identifying the target. It inspects the generated descriptors for the target using all the selected methods and anchors to provide a validation result, which is displayed at the top of the Selection Options window. If adjustments are required, a message will be shown with guidance on how to improve the selection


- ***Blue bullseye:*** signifies the fastest targeting method.  



- ***Checkmark:*** indicates that the targeting method worked but wasn't the fastest.



- ***Duplicate icon:*** represents the presence of duplicates.



- ***Stop sign icon:*** appears when a targeting method fails to identify any elements.

-------------------------


***Native Text Target:*** native text targeting methods are highly valuable for legacy applications where not all elements can be selected, as they enable identification of all text labels within the target application that can be accessed through the native method. 



***Enforce Visibility:*** an option that makes sure elements are only selected and interacted with if they are visible on the screen, enhancing automation accuracy.



***Responsive Websites:*** the capability to automatically adapt and adjust the anchor's position to accommodate changes in layout, enabling automation of websites that are designed to be responsive.

***Fine-Tuning Descriptor***

- Fine-tuning descriptors in automation workflows is crucial for enhancing the reliability and adaptability of the automation process. This involves refining and adjusting descriptor configurations to improve accuracy and overcome challenges like unreliable selectors or dynamic UI elements. While manual editing of descriptors is generally not recommended, there may be rare cases where fine-tuning the Unified targeting method becomes necessary due to unreliable descriptors. Fortunately, there are various techniques available to effectively fine-tune descriptors in such cases




***Key Actions for Fine-Tuning Descriptors***

- When fine-tuning descriptors in automation workflows, there are several key points to consider within the Unified Targeting method, which incorporates a stack of three targeting methods: Selector, Fuzzy Selector, and Image.

- Fine-tuning descriptors is crucial for improving reliability and adaptability in automation workflows.
- Refining and adjusting descriptor configurations enhance accuracy and overcome challenges like unreliable selectors and dynamic UI elements.
- While manual editing of descriptors is generally not recommended, rare cases may require fine-tuning for the Unified targeting method.
- Techniques such as dynamic text targeting, wildcards, the repair function, variables, and adjusting image accuracy are effective for fine-tuning descriptors.
- Wildcards, specifically the asterisk (*) and question mark (?), play a significant role in selector customization. The asterisk (*) is used to replace zero or more characters, while the question mark (?) replaces a single character. 
- Variables and arguments can be used in the Strict Selector or Fuzzy Selector to identify the desired target, either by creating new variables/arguments or selecting from existing ones in the context menu.
- The matching accuracy of the Fuzzy Selector can be adjusted using the Accuracy slider to optimize its performance in selecting targets.
- The Image targeting method can be fine-tuned by adjusting the Image Accuracy using its corresponding slider. This allows for precise control over the accuracy of image-based targeting, ensuring reliable identification of target elements based on visual cues.
