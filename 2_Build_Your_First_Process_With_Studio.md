What is an As-Is Process?
An As-Is business process is a detailed overview of the current state of a company's process, culture, and capabilities. It outlines how work is currently performed and how information flows through the organization. The purpose of an As-Is business process is to provide a baseline for identifying areas for improvement, optimizing the use of resources, and ultimately increasing efficiency and productivity. By understanding how work is currently being performed, organizations can develop strategies to eliminate bottlenecks, reduce waste, and enhance overall business processes.

What is a To-Be Process?
A To-Be business process outlines how a company's process, culture, and capabilities will appear in the future. It serves as a roadmap for change, identifying where the organization needs to be in order to achieve its goals. The purpose of a To-Be business process is to provide a clear picture of what the future state of the organization will look like, and what steps need to be taken to achieve it. By creating a To-Be business process, organizations can prioritize and focus on the most critical changes necessary to achieve their goals and close the gaps between the current and desired states.
