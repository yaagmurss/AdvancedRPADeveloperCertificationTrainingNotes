***Key targeting methods used in UI automation***

- Strict Selectors

- Fuzzy Selectors

- Image


***Target*** 
Refers to a specific UI element that we want to interact with. It could be any component on the user interface, like a button, textbox, or dropdown list. 
To ensure accurate identification of targets, we can use an anchor. 


***Strict Selectors***
Strict Selectors use XML fragments to identify user interface elements based on their attributes. 
They require an exact match to the address and attributes of the element, providing precise targeting. 


***Fuzzy Selectors***
Fuzzy Selectors enable the identification of elements based on patterns or partial matches, allowing for more flexibility. 
They validate selectors using multiple attributes, accommodating changes during the automation process. 

    
***Image***
Image Selection method reads the array of pixels in a visible region of the application window to identify if it matches the target array. 
It's useful when other targeting methods can't be applied or in virtual machine environments. 

    
***Window selector***
The Window Selector targets the entire window or application rather than specific windows within it. 
It's used when automating UI interactions at the application level. 
The Window Selector option is available in the "Use Application or Browser" activity when the "Window Attach Mode" property isn't set to "Single window."


***Unified Targeting Method***
The Unified Target method, 
a modern solution for UI automation, simplifies the interaction with user interfaces by incorporating various technologies and methods like Selectors, 
Fuzzy Selectors, and Images to identify UI elements.
