# ***UI Synchronization***


- UI synchronization activities play a crucial role by allowing the robot to pause and wait for specific UI events before proceeding with the next actions. 


- Use of UI synchronization activities in an automation makes sure the automation process remains aligned with the behavior of the user interface.


- They enable automation to adapt and respond to dynamic UI conditions, leading to accurate and reliable results.

# ***UI synchronization activities and features in Uipath***  



***Check App State Activity*** :   



- This activity allows you to check the state of an application, ensuring that it is in the expected state before proceeding with further actions.

  
- It allows for executing different sets of activities based on whether the element is found or not.

- It can be used as a condition within the Retry Scope activity, enabling retries based on the application's state.

***Verify Execution Feature*** : 

- With this feature, you can verify that a specific action or activity has been successfully executed before moving on to the next step.
  
- The Verify Execution feature in UiPath is used to validate the correctness of actions performed by activities at runtime.

- It verifies the desired outcomes by checking and confirming the appearance or disappearance of specified elements after the activity is executed. 

- The Verify Execution feature is a property available for the Click, Type Into, and Hover activities.

  
- Expected Text Verification: with Verify Execution, you can specify the expected text to be verified for the Type Into activity. This makes sure that the correct text is entered into the defined field.


- Retry Mechanism: the Verify Execution feature provides a retry mechanism that allows for automatic retries of the activities if the expected outcome isn't initially achieved. This increases the chances of a successful execution.


- Element State Verification: the feature enables the verification of element states such as appearance, disappearance, changes in text, or changes in image. This makes sure the desired states are achieved after the activity execution.

***Pick and Pick Branch Activity*** : 


- The Pick Branch activity provides a flexible way to synchronize and execute different branches of activities based on specific conditions or events.
