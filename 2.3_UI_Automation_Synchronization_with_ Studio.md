# ***UI Synchronization***


- UI synchronization activities play a crucial role by allowing the robot to pause and wait for specific UI events before proceeding with the next actions. 


- Use of UI synchronization activities in an automation makes sure the automation process remains aligned with the behavior of the user interface.


- They enable automation to adapt and respond to dynamic UI conditions, leading to accurate and reliable results.

***Check App State Activity*** 



- This activity allows you to check the state of an application, ensuring that it is in the expected state before proceeding with further actions.

  
- It allows for executing different sets of activities based on whether the element is found or not.

- It can be used as a condition within the Retry Scope activity, enabling retries based on the application's state.

***Verify Execution Feature***  



- With this feature, you can verify that a specific action or activity has been successfully executed before moving on to the next step.


  
- The Verify Execution feature in UiPath is used to validate the correctness of actions performed by activities at runtime.

  

- It verifies the desired outcomes by checking and confirming the appearance or disappearance of specified elements after the activity is executed.

  

- The Verify Execution feature is a property available for the Click, Type Into, and Hover activities.

  

  
- ***Expected Text Verification:*** with Verify Execution, you can specify the expected text to be verified for the Type Into activity. This makes sure that the correct text is entered into the defined field.



- ***Retry Mechanism:*** the Verify Execution feature provides a retry mechanism that allows for automatic retries of the activities if the expected outcome isn't initially achieved. This increases the chances of a successful execution.




- ***Element State Verification:*** the feature enables the verification of element states such as appearance, disappearance, changes in text, or changes in image. This makes sure the desired states are achieved after the activity execution.


- The common properties across Click, Type Into, and Hoveractivities for the Verify Execution feature are:
         ***Display name:*** the display name of the verification action.
         ***Retry:*** allows automatic retries if the expected outcome isn't initially achieved. it is enabled by default.
         ***Target:*** indicates the element to be verified at runtime.
         ***Timeout:*** specifies the waiting time for the verification element to appear or disappear.
         ***Verify element:*** defines the type of change to be checked in the verification target.
         ***Expected text:*** to specify the expected text in the target UI element, supporting string values or variables(Additional feature for Type Intoactivity).

***Pick and Pick Branch Activity*** 


- ***The Pick activity*** is a container activity in workflow automation that allows you to monitor multiple input sources simultaneously and execute the appropriate branch of activities based on the first available input. The main component of the Pick activity is the Pick Branch activity.


- ***Pick Branch*** represents a specific branch or path of activities within the Pick activity. Each Pick Branch contains a set of activities that'll be executed when the associated trigger becomes true or the event occurs.

  
- The main components of the Pick Branch activity are Triggers and Actions. Triggers are conditions or events that determine when the branch should be executed. They can be created using variables, expressions, or invoking other workflows. Actions are the activities or tasks that are performed when the trigger condition is met.


- Multiple branches can be defined within the Pick activity, allowing you to handle different conditions or events simultaneously. Each branch can have its own trigger condition and a set of actions to be executed

------------------------------


***Parallel Activity***


- It acts as a container for activities, facilitating coordinated and concurrent execution. In UiPath Studio, the Parallel activity can be found in the Activities panel, under Workflow > Control > Parallel.


- The Parallel activity finishes only after all child activities are complete or when its CompletionCondition property evaluates to true.


- The Parallel Activity allows developers to create workflows that can execute multiple activities concurrently. This enables efficient parallel processing and can greatly enhance the performance of complex workflows.


- Drag and drop activities onto parallel branches. These branches represent separate threads of execution that can run simultaneously.  


- Each parallel branch operates independently of the others, enabling the execution of activities concurrently without dependencies. This is especially beneficial when dealing with tasks that can be performed in parallel and do not rely on the outcomes of activities from other branches.

  
- The Parallel Activity also provides synchronization mechanisms to coordinate the execution of activities across parallel branches.
