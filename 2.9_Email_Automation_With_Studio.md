- Studio provides email automation capabilities through the Mail activities package, the Microsoft Office 365 package, and the Google Workspace activities package.
The Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace packages both use Integration Service connections. This is why you'll find them under the Integrations category in Studio.

# Ways to filter emails

***Filter*** 

- A string used as a filter for the messages to be retrieved. Accepts JET queries or DASL queries.


- Let's assume that you use Outlook and need to retrieve only the email messages that have "Critical" in the beginning of the subject line. 


- In this case, you can also use SQL filtering, and your expression would look like this:



- ***"@SQL=""urn:schemas:httpmail:subject"" like 'Critical%'"***

  

- ***"[Received] >= '" + DateTime.Today.AddDays(-2).ToString("d") + " 00:00AM' AND [Received] < '"+ DateTime.Today.ToString("d") + " 00:00AM'"*** : All mail messages received in the previous two days

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




***Filter By Message Id's***

- Returns only mail messages that match the specified message IDs. If set, the Filter option is ignored. 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------





***Only Unread Messages***

- Specifies whether to retrieve only unread messages. By default, this check box is selected. 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




***Top***

- The number of messages to be retrieved starting from either the newest or the oldest, depending on the OrderByDate parameter. 



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Set up Applications in Google Cloud***


- Before using the Google GSuite Activities Package, you must configure your applications using the Google Cloud Platform.There are two configuration steps.
  

- ***1. Enable APIs*** - this step enables automation by granting API access to your Google G Suite applications.

  
- ***2. Create credentials*** - this specifies the authentication type used to interact with your enabled APIs.





- Once you've enabled APIs and added credentials, you can build automation projects that include Google GSuite activities: 



- ***Classic activities(opens in a new tab)*** - Windows-Legacy and Windows compatible; these use standard authentication methods, via the Scope and Use application card activities.



- ***Activities (opens in a new tab)***- Windows and Cross-platform compatibleâ€”these use Integration Service connections.



- ***Trigger activities(opens in a new tab)*** - Windows and Cross-platform compatible, used to trigger events in Integration Service.

***Triger Activities***

- The following trigger activities are available in the Google Workspace activity package:
- Drive: File Created, Folder Created, File Updated
- Gmail: Email Sent, Email Received
- Calendar: Calendar Event Created, Calendar Event Received, Calendar Event Updated, Calendar Event Replied
- Trigger activities allow an automation to start when a certain external event occurs.
- When you create a process with a trigger activity, the trigger is automatically created in Integration Service, on the selected connection. For example, using the Calendar Event Created activity creates a trigger on the corresponding Gmail connection in Integration Service.
- Unlike standard Integration Service triggers, trigger activities have an output object, which you can use in other activities. 
- An advantage of triggers, both activities and those found in Integration Service directly, is that you don't need a robot to constantly run in the background and check for events. Integration Service checks for events on the selected connection and triggers the workflow when an event is found.
