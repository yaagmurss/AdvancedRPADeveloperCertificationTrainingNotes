# Orchestrator concepts

***Robot(Orchestrator)***
- By now you're familiar with UiPath Robot, the component of the UiPath Platform.
- This is an execution host that runs automation processes published in Orchestrator, as jobs.
- In Orchestrator, a robot entity represents an image or the Robot component, controlling its connection and capabilities.
- The robot entity exists only if it is defined in relation to a user/ robot account in Orchestrator.


***Folder***
- Folders enable the separation and hierarchical organization of automation entities (processes, queues, assets) and the fine-grained configuration of roles and permissions.
- You can create as many sibling folders as you want on a given level.
- The maximum hierarchy depth is 7, meaning you can have a maximum number of 6 nested subfolders under a first-level folder.
- Folders help replicate the organizational hierarchies, with the separation of automated processes between teams, segregation of process data, and access control for users.
- At the same time, when it makes sense, they allow sharing of the resources and assets.

***Package***
- A project developed in UiPath Studio that is published to Orchestrator as a NuGet package.
- Multiple versions of the same project can be stored and used.
- Packages can also be manually uploaded to Orchestrator.
- Additionally, by viewing the versions for a package you can download it from Orchestrator.

***Process***
- It is a version of a package that's been allocated to a certain folder.
- Given that most processes use a queue, asset, or storage bucket, the Package Requirements tab, for when adding a new process, makes it easy to identify which entities your package is using and if they are missing from your folder.

***Job***
- Represents the execution of a process on a UiPath Robot.
- You can launch the execution of a job in either attended or unattended mode.
- You cannot launch a job from Orchestrator on attended robots, unless for debugging purposes using personal workspaces, and they cannot run under a locked screen.

***HeartBeat***
- Attended and unattended robots send a heartbeat to Orchestrator every 30 seconds. This signals to Orchestrator that the connection is working.



# Tenant entities


- From the entities defined above, robots are tenant entities.
-  This means that they can be allocated to multiple folders in that tenant.
-  Using roles and permissions, the way robots work with each of the folders can be customized. 
- Packages are published to Orchestrator using feeds.
- The feeds can be configured to be at tenant level, or at folder level.
- A package published to the tenant feed can then be used in a process in any of the folders. If it is published using a folder feed, it can't be used for processes in other folders.

***There are a couple of other Orchestrator entities which exist at the tenant level:***


***User***
- Both human users and robots are uniquely identified with users in Orchestrator.
- On the Accounts & Groups page, in Automation Cloud, you can define local user accounts, robot accounts, and local groups for your organization.
- The level of access and the actions that your users can perform is controlled using two elements:

    accounts, which establish the identity of a user and are used to log in to your UiPath applications
    roles, which are assigned to accounts in order to grant them certain permissions within the UiPath ecosystem.
- Accounts are not created or managed in Orchestrator, only roles and their assignments are.


***Machines***
- These are Orchestrator entities corresponding to the workstations where human users and robots work.
- Using API keys, they enable the connection between the physical or virtual machines and Orchestrator.

***Licences***
- The right to use Studio and/or Robots, both attended and unattended, is done through licenses.
- Licenses exist at tenant level, from where they get distributed to users, and consumed when the machines connect to Orchestrator.


***WebHook***
- Webhooks facilitate the communication between Orchestrator and other applications at API level.
- These are mapped at tenant level, which means they cannot be differentiated between folders and will provide information for the entire tenant.


# Folder entities

- A folder is a storage area that helps keep your projects separate.
- From the entities defined at the beginning of the lesson, processes and jobs are folder entities. Packages depend on feed configuration.

***Asset***
- An asset is a piece of data stored in Orchestrator for the use of robots. There are four types of assets:

    Text - stores only strings (it isn't required to add quotation marks).
    Bool - supports true or false values.
    Integer - stores only whole numbers.
    Credential - contains usernames and passwords that the Robot requires to execute particular processes, such as login details.

- Assets can have a global value or a value per user. This means that only the specified user will access a certain value stored in that asset.


***Storage buckets***
- Storage buckets are entities used for storing files which can be used in automation projects.


***Queue***
- Queues are containers that can hold an unlimited number of items, storing different types of data.
- The process of feeding items to a queue is typically different from the process of processing the queue items, and is handled by different robots.


***Trigger***
- Triggers enable the execution of jobs in a preplanned manner:
- Time triggers—they instruct the automation to start at regular intervals.
- Queue triggers—they instruct the automation to be activated whenever new items are added to your queues. 
- Event triggers—they instruct the automation to start whenever a specified event occurs.
