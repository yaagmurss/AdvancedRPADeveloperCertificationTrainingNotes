# Debugging 

- Debugging is the process of finding and fixing issues that prevent your automation project from functioning correctly. It allows you to step through your workflow, track the execution flow, and inspect variables and values at each step.

  

***Best practices***


- Don't build lengthy sequences, since it'll become difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.


- Using Log Message activities to trace the evolution of a running process is essential for supervising, diagnosing, and debugging a process.


- Avoid adding code on transitions. It isn't visible, and therefore difficult to debug and maintain.


- After each component is built, unit testing should be conducted. If every component is thoroughly tested, the integration runs more smoothly, and debugging lasts for a shorter period of time.




***Breakpoints*** 


- Breakpoints allow us to pause execution at specific activities, while trace points enhance breakpoints with logging capabilities. By using conditions and hit counts, we can create conditional breakpoints and gain more control over when the debugging process pauses. Additionally, trace points can be used solely for logging purposes without interrupting execution. 

- These tools enable us to troubleshoot and analyze workflows effectively, leading to more efficient debugging and improved automation outcomes. 



***Run to this activity and Run from this activity***

 

- Run to this activity will debug the project and stop before the selected activity is executed. We can use this action to check the first part of our workflow.

 

- Run from this activity will start debugging from the selected activity. By using this action, we can skip the first part of our workflow and set values for variables for debugging the second part.




 # ***The Panels: Watch, Immediate, and Call Stack***



- ***The Watch panel*** allows developers to add variables and expressions, providing real-time visibility into their values. This helps quickly identify discrepancies during workflow execution. 


- ***The Call Stack panel*** visually displays the sequence of activities and function calls, helping pinpoint specific areas where errors occur. It enables efficient troubleshooting and error localization. 


- ****The Immediate panel*** offers a dynamic debugging experience by executing custom expressions and evaluating variables without modifying the workflow. This allows for quick validation of expressions and logic. 


# ***Profile Execution***



- With the ability to analyze profiling results and take necessary optimization actions, you will enhance the efficiency and performance of your automation solutions.
