# File and Folder Automation

File and Folder Automation involves automating tasks you do with your files and folders on your computer, like creating, copying, or renaming them. 

- ***Copy*** : copying a file or a folder from a specified location to another with the "Copy File" and "Copy Folder" activities. 

- ***Create*** : create an empty file in a specified location or a folder in a specified location with the "Create File" and "Create Folder" activities.

- ***Delete*** : delete a file or folder with the "Delete File" and "Delete Folder" activities.

- ***Move*** : the "Move File" and "Move Folder" activities allow you to move a file or a folder, giving you the option to overwrite duplicates.

- ***Rename*** : with the "Rename File" and "Rename Folder" actions, you can rename either a file or folder, while being able to choose between keeping the extension or not, in the case of a file.

- ***Browse for...*** : the "Select File" action opens a dialog box during runtime which allows you to choose the file you want to work with. "Browse for Folders" works similarly, but of course for folders.

- ***Check if an item exists*** "File Exists" and "Folder Exists" are two activities that check whether a file or folder exists. We need to provide the file or folder path and the result can be saved in a Boolean variable. Later on, this variable can be used in other activities: e.g. as a condition in an If activity - if the file exists, then skip the current file.

- ***Iterate through*** : "For Each File in Folder" iterates through all the files in a folder, while "For Each Folder in Folder" does that for all the folders in a folder.

- ***Get info*** : with the "Get File Info" and "Get Folder Info" actions, we can obtain the information about a file or a folder and store it in a variable of type "FileInfo".

- ***Work with archives*** : the "Compress/Zip Files" action enables us to add files or folders to a compressed file. The "Extract/Unzip Files" action helps extract all contents of a compressed file to a specified folder.
