***A selector in UiPath Studio*** is a feature that enables the identification of a specific User Interface element through its address and attributes. These selectors are stored as XML fragments.
The element identification is performed to execute specific activities in an automation project. 
Selectors are generated when UI elements are indicated for activities which require target element(s).

- Selectors in UiPath Studio are XML fragments and enable the identification of specific user interface elements.
- Selectors consist of nodes, each of which is composed of tags and attributes.
- Selectors use these tags to specify which elements they want to target and apply styles or perform actions on.
- Attribute provides specific information about the element, such as its name, ID, class, title, or type. These attributes are used to find and perform actions on the desired elements during automation.
