***Creating queues***

- Queues are easily created in Orchestrator from the entry in the menu with the same name. They are folder entities, which allow setting up fine-grained permissions.

- When creating a queue, you set the maximum number of retries (the number of times you want a queue item to be retried) and the Unique Reference field (select Yes, if you want the transaction references to be unique).
-  You can update existing queue settings, such as: The queue name.The Auto Retry option.The maximum number of retries.

- In Orchestrator, newly created queues are empty by default. To populate them with items you can either use the upload functionality in Orchestrator, or Studio activities. Bulk upload is supported directly in Orchestrator, from .csv files.

***Populating and consuming queues***

- To ensure an optimal use of the robots, queues are typically used with the Dispatcher-Performer model of running automations. In this model, the two main stages of a process involving queues are separated:

- The stage in which data is taken and fed into a queue in Orchestrator, from where it can be taken and processed by the robots is called Dispatcher.

- The stage in which the data is processed is called Performer.
